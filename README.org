* FuncKit

This is an implementation of basic functional programming concepts in swift.
It's also a living documentation of my journey into functional programming. I
found I use these snippets constantly in my different projects, so I think it's
a good idea to make a framework out of it. Easier for me to improve upon.

For usage detail, checkout the unit tests.
